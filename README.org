* ApexBot

Toy Bot for my personal discord server.

Main usage is to view current map and crafting rotations without logging into Apex.

** Available Commands
=/maprotations= - Shows current and next map. Also shows remaining time for current map and next map duration

=/crafting= - Shows *only* weeklies and daily crafting items

=/commands= - Show all commands

** Run Locally with docker
Ensure that .env contains the following variables

- DISCORD_KEY=discord_key
- TARGET_CHANNEL=target_channel
- APEX_API=apex_api
- APEX_API_KEY=apex_api_key

Run the app using docker:
#+begin_src bash
  docker build -t apexbot .
  docker run --env-file .env apexbot
#+end_src
